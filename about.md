## Overview of App:

Do you remember how many times you felt disappointed with your wine selection? In order to achieve this, you may need a good guide while deciding to select the wine. My app can help to find the best wine in a short time according to many tasters’ experience/reviews and user’s criteria, which are taster name, price range, country, score range and variety, the user can also extend or narrow the filters as she wishes.

## How to use the app?

You can `price`, `country`, `points`, and `variety` variables according to your preferences.

Warning! In some cases, the results may not change since the extra filter you added would not affect the results. Don't give up add some more `country`. `variety`, or change your `price range`.

I hope you will find the wine of your choice!
